########

The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on
resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental
sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart
watches, and IoT wireless applications.

**********
The Zephyr kernel supports multiple architectures, including:
 - ARC EM and HS
 - ARMv6-M, ARMv7-M, and ARMv8-M (Cortex-M)
 - ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A (Cortex-A, 32- and 64-bit)
 - ARMv7-R, ARMv8-R (Cortex-R, 32- and 64-bit)
 - Intel x86 (32- and 64-bit)
 - NIOS II Gen 2
 - RISC-V (32- and 64-bit)
 - SPARC V8
 - Tensilica Xtensa
